# Urban-Growth-Model---London

London Urban Growth predictive analysis

Using Open source data, a predictive model is prepared that uses fishnet created on ArcGIS for spatial data and tests it in R for statistcally significant change / variation.
Using techniques in Machine Learning, a training and test set is used to predict and validate future changes in the urban fabric. Furthermore, prescriptive analysis is performed using suggested design and infrastructure changes in the city's transit network to model growth patterns in less developed areas.
